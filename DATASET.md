# Example Datasets

To help users try out this tool, we provide three sample datasets in the `datasets/` folder:

- **Iris dataset**  
- **Wine dataset**  
- **Thyroid dataset** (from Stefan Aeberhard: 3 classes, 215 instances, 5 attributes)

These datasets have been converted to CSV format for compatibility with Excel. Below are the original dataset sources for reference:

- [Wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine)  
- [Thyroid dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/thyroid+disease)
